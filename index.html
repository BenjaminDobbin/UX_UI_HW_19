        <h1>Benjamin Dobbin</h1>
        <p>My background is in photography, interior design, and people management,
           but I transitioned into the world of product design when I discovered my 
           passion for combining user research with UX design. Being able to unite 
           my visual storytelling skills with my enthusiasm for problem-solving & 
           team management is what I find most fulfilling. I believe great design 
           demands tackling complex problems with compassion and envisioning 
           innovative solutions.</p>

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>It all starts with the user.  I focus on the methodic analysis of target users—including their needs and pain points—to find the sharpest possible insights to make the best designs and find real solutions.</p>

        <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
        <p>Content is the reason why people will use a product. We must produce content that users will find valuable, but it is equally important is to make sure that the content is easy to find. Time is the most treasured resource users have, and well thought out information architecture is integral to a sound user experience.    </p>

        <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
        <p>Based on research, I want to anticipate users' needs and ensure that the interface is easy to understand and uses elements to meet those needs. By bringing together concepts from interaction design, visual design, and information architecture, I always aim to create stunning and valuable experiences.</p>

          <h4>Vesta Smart Fridge</h4>
          <p>What if 'smart' refrigerators were actually smart? For this project, we teleported to the not-so-distant future to reimagine the possibilities of how a truly intelligent fridge could revolutionize what managing a kitchen looks like and how we could reduce food waste and save users time.</p>

          <h4>Austin Zoo Redesign</h4>
          <p>With KPIs and Conversion being a top priority, we completely rebuilt the Austin Zoo website. Using interviews, surveys, and ethnographic research, we looked at how the Austin Zoo could connect with its visitors better and show them everything the Zoo has to offer.</p>

          <h4>Bureau of Land Management</h4>
          <p>In this case study, I took a deep dive into the information architecture of the Bureau of Land Management's website. During the research phase, I identified two distinct user personas and set out to build something that would better serve both users' needs and goals.</p>
